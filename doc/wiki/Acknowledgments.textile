This section provides a list of the people that have contributed in some way to the creation of Pipes.

# "Marko A. Rodriguez":http://markorodriguez.com -- designed, developed, tested, and documented Pipes.
# "Darrick Weibe":http://github.com/pangloss -- implemented Pipe paths.

Please review Pipes' "pom.xml":http://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/blob/master/pom.xml. Pipes would not be possible without the work done by others to create these useful packages.

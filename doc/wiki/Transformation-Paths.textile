Pipes supports the notion of transformation paths. That is, its possible to know how an object at the end a Pipe was transformed through all the stages of the Pipe.

```java
Pipe<Object, Object> pipeline = new Pipeline<Object,Object>(...);
pipeline.setStarts(new SingleIterator<Object>(o));
while(pipeline.hasNext()) {
  Object object = pipeline.next();
  List<Object> path = pipeline.getPath();
}
```

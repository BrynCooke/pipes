A common Pipes pattern is the filtering of objects. This section discusses the basics of filtering and then explains the @ComparisonFilterPipe@ interface and its implementations.

h2(#basic). Basic Filtering

A filter-based pipe will consume objects and either emit them or not. If they are *not emitted*, then they are considered *filtered* by the pipe. A useful interface to implement that describes this behavior is @FilterPipe<S> extends Pipe<S,S>@. A basic filter is defined below. This pipe is called @RandomFilterPipe@ and it comes with the Pipes distribution. @RandomFilterPipe@ will only allow a consumed object to be emitted if a biased coin toss lands on "heads." At the extremes, if @bias@ is 0.0 then no incoming objects are emitted and if @bias@ is 1.0, then every incoming object is emitted.

```java
public class RandomFilterPipe<S> extends AbstractPipe<S, S> implements FilterPipe<S> {
    private static final Random RANDOM = new Random();
    private final double bias;
    public SampleFilterPipe(final double bias) {
        this.bias = bias;
    }
    protected S processNextStart() {
        while (this.starts.hasNext()) {
            S s = this.starts.next();
            if (bias >= RANDOM.nextDouble()) {
                return s;
            }
        }
        throw new NoSuchElementException();
    }
}
```

The @processNextStart()@ method structure above is a common pattern in filter-based pipes. In short, a @while(this.starts.hasNext())@ is evaluated until an incoming start/object meets the criteria and is returned (i.e. emitted). If there are no more starts and the criteria is not met, then a @NoSuchElementException@ is thrown. Beware of using recursion to accomplish a similar behavior. As the amount of data grows that is streaming through a process graph, recursion-based methods can easily yield a @StackOverflowError@.

h2(#comparison). Comparison-Based Filtering

More complicated filters can be created than what was presented above. These filters usually check objects to determine whether to emit them or not. There is an interface called @ComparisonFilterPipe<S,T>@. Implementations of this interface consume objects of type @S@. If a check of that object passes (returns @true), then the @S@ object is emitted, else it is filtered. @ComparisonFilterPipe@ has the following signature:

```java
public interface ComparisonFilterPipe<S, T> extends FilterPipe<S> {
    public enum Filter {
        EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN_EQUAL, LESS_THAN_EQUAL
    }
    public boolean compareObjects(T leftObject, T rightObject);
}
```

The important method is @compareObjects()@. This method returns @true@ if the left hand object is @EQUAL@, @NOT_EQUAL@, etc. to the right hand object.

Next, there is an abstract class called @AbstractComparisonFilterPipe<S,T>@ that implements @ComparisonFilterPipe@. More specifically, it provides a standard implementation of @ComparisonFilterPipe.compareObjects()@. For most situations, this method is sufficient. However, if not, simply override the method with an implementation that meets the requirements of the designed pipe.

```java
public boolean compareObjects(final T leftObject, final T rightObject) {
        switch (this.filter) {
            case EQUAL:
                if (null == leftObject)
                    return rightObject == null;
                return leftObject.equals(rightObject);
            case NOT_EQUAL:
                if (null == leftObject)
                    return rightObject != null;
                return !leftObject.equals(rightObject);
            case GREATER_THAN:
                if (null == leftObject || rightObject == null)
                    return true;
                return ((Comparable) leftObject).compareTo(rightObject) == 1;
            case LESS_THAN:
                if (null == leftObject || rightObject == null)
                    return true;
                return ((Comparable) leftObject).compareTo(rightObject) == -1;
            case GREATER_THAN_EQUAL:
                if (null == leftObject || rightObject == null)
                    return true;
                return ((Comparable) leftObject).compareTo(rightObject) >= 0;
            case LESS_THAN_EQUAL:
                if (null == leftObject || rightObject == null)
                    return true;
                return ((Comparable) leftObject).compareTo(rightObject) <= 0;
            default:
                throw new RuntimeException("Invalid state as no valid filter was provided");
        }
    }
```

Note: it many situations, such as @ObjectFilterPipe@, the right hand object to allow or disallow is stored in the pipe and compared with each object passed through it.

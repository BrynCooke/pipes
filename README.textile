Pipes is a "dataflow":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow framework that enables the splitting, merging, filtering, and transformation of data from input to output. Computations are expressed using a "combinator":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition model and are evaluated in a memory-efficient, "lazy":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation fashion.

The documentation for Pipes can be found at this "location":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com. Finally, please visit "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com for other software products.

Pipes is a graph-based data flow framework written in Java 1.6+. A process graph (also known as a "Kahn process network":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks) is composed of a set of process vertices connected to one another by a set of communication edges. Each process can run independent of the others and as such, concurrency is a natural consequence as data is transformed in a pipelined fashion from input to output.

The following is a list of extensions to the core Pipes framework:

* "Property Graph Model":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com: a collection of single-step traversals can be composed to yield complex graph traversals

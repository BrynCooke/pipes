Pipes is a graph-based data flow framework written in Java 1.6+. A process graph (also known as a "Kahn process network":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks) is composed of a set of process vertices connected to one another by a set of communication edges. Each process can run independent of the others and as such, concurrency is a natural consequence as data is transformed in a pipelined fashion from input to output.

The following is a list of extensions to the core Pipes framework:

* "Property Graph Model":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com: a collection of single-step traversals and filters can be composed to yield complex graph traversals over:
** "TinkerGraph":http://wiki.github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph in-memory property graph
** "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/ graph database
** "Sesame 2.0":http://www.openrdf.org/ compliant RDF stores
